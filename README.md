# Profile Web-Page 

## Description 

This is a website that showcases a progressive development of my studies. This website will progress further as I progress through the course.

Within the header we have a navigation bar which takes us to a different page. Each page demonstrates a different topic we covered in class, from simple understanding of html tags to flex box.  

It have been made responsive for mobile first use.
