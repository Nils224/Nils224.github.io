# Homework-week-1

## Description 

This is a website that showcases what I have learnt in the first two weeks of this coding bootcamp.

Within the header we have a navigation bar which takes us to a different page. Each page demonstrates a different topic we covered in class, from simple understanding of html tags to flex box. 

The future of this project is to make it responsive and develop it further as I progress in the course.
